Development
	C# prototype using kinect that will trace when each motion is captured
		Kinect automatically loads on start
		left hand
		right hand
		left + right hand
		arms open
		arms closed
		TEST:
			height
			multiple people
			
	C# prototype using speech that will trace when each voice command is captured
		Kinect automatically loads on start
		"Travel to" and alternates
		each planetary body
		"zoom in/out"
	
	C# Prototype that will load up space simulation
		Allow manual keyboard+mouse interactions
			travel to each planet
			zoom on each planet

	Integrate prototypes, map "traces" to simulation commands, keep keyboard+mouse as alternates
