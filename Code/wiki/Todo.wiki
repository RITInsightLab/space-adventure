    * *Description:* 






= Bugs =

  1. _Consolidate Scripts to One File_
    * Right now, each travel command is in a different celestia script. A better way to do this would be to find some way to pass in command-line arguments to a celestia script, and have it look up a _function_ relating to the behavior we want. That would be much cleaner.

  3. _Clean up in-line documentation_
    * Make sure code is readable and understandable

  4. _Clean up written documentation_
    * Make sure SRS and use-case is correct and complete

  5. _Package Space Adventure into executable_
    * There needs to be a single executable file to launch the program

  6. _Test on Projectors_
    * It needs to be tested on the fully set-up project

  7. _Protect Archive from Stupid People_
    * Move it to a server and add a note, extract most useful info
